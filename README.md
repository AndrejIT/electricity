Electricity mod for minetest game.

Reworked from mesecons mod https://github.com/minetest-mods/mesecons/

Mesecons are great, but too much to be suitable to be put on survival server.
Also, Mesecons code segmentation was too mind-blowing for me to make any modifications. (at least when i started)

So i introduced my own concept.
Hopefully, it will work well enough.
And surely it will be fun!
